The Alphabet Soup of Term Sheets: Part
One (Economics)
Now, let’s assume your startup story is compelling enough that you receive
a term sheet from a VC. This is an exciting moment for many founders . . .
and then their eyes start to cross. What do all those terms mean? How do
you evaluate them? What’s standard, what’s not; what’s a good deal versus
a bad deal?
As I mentioned at the beginning of this book, the term sheet is where
information asymmetry between VCs and founders comes into play the
most, and often at the expense of the founder. This is because VCs have
been through this process many times and have negotiated hundreds of
term sheets. By contrast, founders only get a few shots on goal in a lifetime
and likely can count the number of term sheets they have negotiated on
one hand. This is normal, but it puts the founder at a disadvantage that I
would very much like to correct. It is my goal in this chapter and the next
to unpack the term sheet, including some explanation of how VCs think
about various terms so that entrepreneurs can be informed and clear
about what their term sheets mean for them and their business.
The term sheet is a magnum opus, by any measure, and there are a lot
of mechanics to understand. I’m going to simplify the very long term sheet
into two big buckets—economics and governance.
This chapter, the economics bucket, includes the sections that talk
about the size of the investment, valuation, antidilution treatment,
liquidation preference, the size of the employee option pool, and vesting of
options and founder shares. Not surprisingly, these items occupy a lot of
the attention of both parties in the negotiation. And they are certainly
important. But the other big bucket probably has much greater long-term
ramifications for the success of the company.
Chapter 10 details the governance bucket. This addresses who gets a say
in what happens in the company.
One more note before we dig into the term sheet. I created a standard
example of a term sheet for you, which you will find on this page. It’s a
sample term sheet for a Series A financing for hypothetical XYZ Company
to be led by Venture Capital Fund I (VCF1.) Please reference it as we go
through chapters 9 and 10.
Now, just as a Broadway playbill gives you a cast of characters and a
short description of each role, let’s go through the various terms of a deal.
We’re starting with the economics section of a term sheet—the money
decisions.
Security: Preferred Shares
We mentioned earlier that one of the benefits of a C corp is that we can
have different classes of shareholders with different rights. Well, here it is:
VCF1 is going to purchase Series A preferred shares of the company. These
are distinct from common shares (which is what the founders and
employees typically hold) and they are also different from potential future
series of preferred stock (that will likely be labeled “Series B,” “Series C,”
ad infinitum). As you’ll see as we progress further in the term sheet, the
whole reason for creating a new class of stock is to give it “preferred”
economic and governance rights relative to those enjoyed by the common
shareholders.
Aggregate Proceeds
This one’s pretty easy—the term sheet says that VCF1 is going to invest
$10 million into the company in exchange for a 20 percent ownership
interest. The second part of the section is intended to make sure that, to
the extent the company has any other debt outstanding, in connection
with this investment, all those notes will convert into equity under the
terms of this financing. The reason VCs care about this is that notes (or
debt) are generally senior to equity; that is, if the company were to go out
of business, the notes would get paid back out of any remaining proceeds
before the equity. So, if a VC is going to invest in the company, she doesn’t
want other monies to be ahead of her in the event of a potential
liquidation. By forcing all the notes to convert into equity in this round,
the VC ensures that everyone is in the same position with respect to the
distribution of proceeds in the event of an exit (at least until we start
talking about liquidation preferences shortly!).
We touched briefly at the beginning of the book on debt and mentioned
that many startups raise convertible debt in connection with their initial
seed financing. Recall that convertible debt means that the instrument
starts out as debt but can be converted into equity based on the
occurrence of certain events. In most cases, the debt will convert into
equity in connection with an equity financing round, typically in a Series A
financing like the one we are discussing here.
More about Convertible Debt
There are several flavors of convertible debt. In its most basic form, the
debt converts into equity at the same price at which the Series A investors
purchase equity. This is referred to as an “uncapped” note, meaning that
the valuation at which the note converts is not restricted and will be
determined based upon the Series A equity price. Investors,
understandably so, are often hesitant to purchase this debt because they
are investing at one of the riskiest stages of the company’s life cycle—
companies generally are using this seed capital to begin building their first
product—and are not getting paid adequately for this risk. Rather, they are
paying the same price ultimately as the Series A investors, who have the
benefit of putting their capital at risk at a slightly later stage of maturity of
the company.
As a result, most convertible debt has one or both of the following
features. “Capped” notes establish a ceiling on the maximum price at
which the debt will convert into equity. For example, a convertible note
with a $5 million valuation cap means that in no case will the debt convert
into equity at a price higher than $5 million. If the Series A round
valuation comes in below the cap—say $4 million—then the debt holder
gets the benefit of that lower valuation. And if the Series A valuation
exceeds the cap—say $10 million—then the debt holder converts at the $5
million cap, in this case a full 50 percent discount to the Series A investor.
The second feature is a conversion discount, with or without a cap. For
example, the convertible note may provide that it converts at a 10 percent
discount to the Series A financing valuation. In the case of an uncapped
note with a 10 percent discount, the nominal conversion price will move
up or down with the Series A price but always remains at a 10 percent
discount to that price. If you coupled a cap with a 10 percent discount,
then the conversion would follow the same principles as the capped note
above: the note holder would get the benefit of the discount up to the
point at which the cap provides a more favorable conversion price.
Why do entrepreneurs choose to issue convertible debt at the seed stage
of financing versus raising traditional equity? Oftentimes, entrepreneurs
do this for cost and simplicity reasons; the standard convertible debt
documents are pretty simple and don’t require much legal time and
expense. The other benefit of convertible debt is that it allows both the
entrepreneur and the seed investor to punt on the question of valuation at
this early stage of company development. Rather than having a big
negotiation around pricing at the seed round, the parties essentially defer
that discussion until the Series A financing. However, once you start to
introduce the cap concept into a convertible debt round, it’s no longer the
case that you are truly deferring that valuation discussion. In effect, you
are agreeing on the maximum valuation at which the debt will convert into
equity; this sounds awfully similar to agreeing on a valuation!
One very common mistake that we see entrepreneurs make is to raise
too much convertible debt in the early days of the company such that they
end up giving away too much of the company to outside investors. Why
does this happen? For a couple of reasons.
First, as noted above, the main feature of convertible debt is that it
allows an entrepreneur to raise money quickly and with much less legal
expense than would be typically associated with an equity financing. This
is because the legal instrument is very simple to document and is often set
up to allow the company to raise additional capital relatively easily beyond
the current investment. In contrast, equity financings typically require
execution of a myriad of documents, and amendments to those documents
typically require consent of the existing equity holders.
As a result, convertible debt financings can often have multiple, rolling
closings, whereas an equity financing typically has only one closing. While
this distinction may sound trivial in theory, in practice it has real
consequences. We see many entrepreneurs who decide to raise $1 million
in a convertible note and close on that money very quickly. But commonly
some other investors will come along a few months later and indicate that
they, too, would like to join in the financing. Most entrepreneurs
acquiesce to this, since more money is typically better than less. And then
the process has a way of repeating itself a few more times, each in
relatively small dollar increments, but with the end result of the
entrepreneur finding that she has over time raised $2.5–$3 million on the
same financial terms on which she set out originally to raise $1 million.
Depending on the way the note was written, each new financing round
might require the new investors to execute a separate note, but this is a
relatively trivial process and does not create an obstacle to these rolling
closings.
The second feature of the note then becomes more apparent to the
entrepreneur when she decides to raise a regular equity round of financing
from a venture capitalist—her Series A financing. Although the notes may
have a valuation cap or specify that the notes will convert at some fixed
discount to the Series A equity, because the actual conversion price is not
known until the Series A financing price is agreed upon (which of course
occurs sometime in the future when the Series A investor agrees to a deal),
the actual effect of the notes on the company’s equity capitalization is also
not determined until such time as the Series A financing happens. In
contrast, when an entrepreneur does a regular equity financing, the actual
dilutive effect of the transaction is made clear at the closing of the
financing when the new shares have to be issued to the new investor; thus,
the entrepreneur knows exactly how much of the company she ultimately
still owns.
As a result, a fact pattern we see very often at the time of a Series A
financing is that the entrepreneur is surprised to learn that she has sold
much more of the equity than she anticipated through a series of these
convertible notes. Not only can this be upsetting to the entrepreneur, but
it also can be problematic for the Series A investor. After all, the new
investor wants the entrepreneur to be highly motivated in the form of
owning a lot of the equity of the company—what better way to align
incentives than to have the entrepreneur get rich alongside a great
investment return to the venture capitalist? But if the entrepreneur owns
too little of the company at such an early stage of the company’s life, the
likelihood is that either she will become demotivated over the coming
years or the VCs will need to grant her more equity down the road to
maintain her economic interest.
But that additional equity that may be granted to the founder doesn’t
just get created out of thin air. Rather, doing so requires that the company
increase the total amount of equity and issue those new shares to the
founder. But that means that everyone else who did not receive that
additional equity (including both other employees and investors) will have
their ownership interest in the company “diluted,” or reduced by the
amount of the new equity issuance. Thus, creating the right incentives
comes with a cost.
Let’s look at a simple example. Imagine that you are the founder and
own 70 shares of equity out of a total of 100 shares in the company; you
have a 70 percent ownership interest in the company. For sake of
simplicity, let’s assume that the other 30 shares are owned by the
company’s other employees. As a result of debt converting into equity,
assume that we had to issue 20 additional shares of equity to the debt
holders. Your ownership in the company has now been reduced—you still
own 70 shares in total, but the total number of shares has increased to
120. As a result, your 70 percent ownership has been diluted to 58 percent
(70/120).
If the Series A investors are worried that this dilution may disincent you
from working hard to increase the equity value of the company, they may
not want to invest in the Series A without increasing your ownership back
to, say, 65 percent. How can they do that? Again, by having the company
create additional shares and issue them to you. If you do the math, you
would need to receive an additional 23 shares (to get you to a total of 93
shares), and the creation of those shares would increase the total shares in
the company to 143. Thus, 93/143 = 65 percent. But notice that our poor
employees still own 30 shares and have seen their ownership in the
company reduced from 30 percent to 21 percent (30/143).
This dance between these two competing interests—properly incenting
an entrepreneur and minimizing the dilution for other shareholders—is a
carefully choreographed one that recurs many times throughout the life
cycle of a company. So encountering it early on can be a tough way to get a
relationship started.
What often happens to resolve this tension? One option is just to kick
the can down the road. That is, the investor invests at the Series A round,
the entrepreneur gets what she gets, and everyone agrees that we just
might need to solve this dilution problem sometime into the future. While
we’ve seen this happen many times, it’s really not the best solution; unlike
whiskey, most problems don’t in fact age well.
The second option is to address it up front. While better to confront
these issues head-on, this is a tough one to navigate. Why? Because the
new investor coming into the Series A round will want to solve this by
having the company issue more stock to the entrepreneur to offset the
dilution she has suffered from the convertible debt offerings. But of course
those debt investors don’t want to do that because that dilution will come
largely out of their ownership stake. And so the dance continues until the
parties can come to some compromise that works for all involved.
The bottom line is that this problem can be avoided easily by just being
mindful as an entrepreneur of this constant trade-off between raising the
capital you need to grow your business and minimizing the dilution to
yourself and other employees and investors who are coming along the
journey with you. For every dollar of VC you take, do the calculation to
figure out what that means for your existing crew of people involved.
Price per Share
Our sample term sheet says two important things about the price that the
VCs are willing to pay for the $10 million investment.
First, the valuation is $50 million “post-money”—what does that mean?
“Post-money” means exactly what is sounds like: the valuation of the
company once the VC has invested her $10 million. You’ll often hear VCs
use the term “pre-money” as well; this is the valuation of the company
before the VC makes her investment. So, mathematically, pre-money +
amount of investment = post-money (in our example, since VCF1 is
investing $10 million and has said that the post-money valuation is $50
million, the pre-money must be $40 million).
You’ll see that VCF1 says in the first section of the term sheet that it
wants 20 percent ownership of the company for its $10 million
investment. Hopefully, you can see that the math makes sense here—if I
put in $10 million and the post-money valuation is $50 million, then I
should own 20 percent of the company ($10 million investment divided by
$50 million post-money valuation). So far, so good.
Note also that the term sheet says that the post-money valuation
includes two important elements.
First, any shares that convert as a result of prior convertible debt (called
“notes” in the term sheet) have to be included in this valuation. Recall our
discussion about the use of convertible debt by many entrepreneurs,
particularly in the early stages of company financing. We said at the time
that a common mistake we see is the aggregation of quite a bit of
convertible debt as a result of the rolling closes that debt permits. Here is
where the sins of the past can come back to bite us, as that debt is now
being taken into account as part of the valuation the VC is willing to pay.
We now for the first time get the full accounting of just how much dilution
has been created by the issuing of this debt, and this bill often catches
entrepreneurs by surprise.
Second, and we’ll talk about this more below, the valuation also includes
the employee option pool (this is the stock set aside to incent employees of
the company). This is important, because it means that when we add up
all these shares, they can’t exceed the $50 million post-money valuation
for the company.
The VC could have said—and the founders would have preferred this—
that the valuation is $50 million after it puts its money into the company,
but that the conversion of the notes and the employee option pool would
be additive to the post-money valuation. But, in that case, the VC wouldn’t
really own 20 percent of the company when all is said and done. She
would own that amount for a fraction of a second and then get diluted by
the additional shares issued for the note conversions and the employee
option pool.
This is why the VC wrote the term sheet to hard-code the post-money
valuation at $50 million. She wanted to be clear that whatever the existing
capital structure of the company and however big an employee option pool
the founders wanted to create, the VC would not be diluted by those.
So how did VCF1 come up with the $50 million post-money valuation in
the first place? Let’s take a short diversion to explore valuation in a bit
more detail. If you have a background in investment banking, you’ll be
familiar with how banks tend to value companies. This is similar.
Comparable Company Analysis
We covered this briefly in chapter 5, but the comparable company analysis
method of valuation requires that we find other publicly traded companies
(or companies whose valuation and financial metrics are publicly known)
that look and feel like the startup we are trying to value—so-called
comparable companies.
Oversimplified, it’s like looking at comp prices in your neighborhood
when you are trying to buy or sell your house as a way to help set the price
of your house or your offer.
As a better example, if we were trying to value Facebook in early 2012
(while it was still private), we might choose a set of other high-growth
internet companies as comparables—e.g., Yahoo, Google. We would then
look at how those companies are valued as a function of certain financial
metrics: for example, Yahoo might have been valued at five times its
revenue, while Google might have been valued at eight times its revenue.
We then apply these revenue multiples to Facebook’s revenue to arrive at
an estimate of how the public markets would value Facebook.
Easy math, hard comparison. Maybe Facebook has a higher growth rate
than these companies. Maybe Facebook has a higher margin structure.
Maybe Facebook has a larger market opportunity to go after. Maybe
Yahoo just missed its Wall Street estimates last quarter and thus investors
have put it in the penalty box by selling the stock and thereby depressing
the valuation. Or maybe the US is on the verge of World War III (we all
hope not!) and thus equity market valuations as a class are at a local
minimum. None of these questions is insurmountable, but they do go to
the heart of whether “comparables” are in fact comparable.
This analysis is doubly hard as applied to startups because (we hope)
startups are by definition unique, and the ability to forecast revenue is
inherently unpredictable. So even if we get the comparables right, who
knows if we will get our revenue forecast right—garbage in, garbage out.
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
Financial theory says—and who are we to argue with it—that over the long
run, the value of a company equals the present value of its future cash
flows. That is, whatever annual cash a company can generate in the future,
if we discount that cash to present-day values, an investor should be
willing to pay no more than the current value of that stream of future cash.
How do we do this in practice? Well, it requires that you build out a
financial forecast for your company, estimating how much cash flow the
company will generate in each future year. Keep in mind that cash flow
means “cash”—so we need to estimate not just what the accounting
income will be for the company but also how capital expenditures will
affect cash and how the timing of collecting cash from customers and
paying cash to vendors and employees (otherwise known as “working
capital”) works. Once we know that, we then need to discount those cash
flows back to present day using what’s called a “discount rate.” The simple
way to think about discount rate is that it is the opportunity cost for a
company’s investments—so, if the company could earn 10 percent on
alternative investments, then we should discount the future cash flows at
least at that rate.
As you are probably noticing, this analysis makes sense for mature
companies that have more predictable future financial results based on
the history of their existing financial results. It’s really tough to do this for
an early-stage startup given that the financial forecasts for the business
are probably not worth more than the Excel spreadsheet on which they
were created. VCs often joke that “we can make the spreadsheet say
whatever we want.”
More significantly for startups—for those of you familiar with
discounted cash flow models—because they tend to consume cash in the
early years and (hopefully) generate cash in the mature years, most of the
value in a discounted cash flow model will come from the far-out years,
where the certainty of forecasts gets even more fuzzy.
In addition to all these challenges, the comparable company and
discounted cash flow analyses also suffer from the fact that they don’t
account for dilution in the VCs’ equity holdings resulting from future
financings. Huh?
When a VC invests in a startup company, she hopes that may be the last
money the company ever needs to raise, but knows in her heart that that is
highly unlikely. Most companies that are successful (and unfortunately
many of those that are not) end up raising multiple rounds of financing. In
fact, given that companies are staying private for a longer time, they are
more likely to raise funding across several different rounds of financing.
To plan for this, when a VC invests in the first round of a company, she
“reserves” additional monies beyond that which she invests in the A round
to be able to participate in future financing rounds and preserve her
ownership.
How does this work? Going back to our sample term sheet, if VCF1
invests $10 million to own 20 percent of the company, assuming that the
company continues to do well, VCF1 will want to maintain that ownership
level. But if the company raises another round of financing, the company
will need to issue more shares to that next round investor. As a result, the
total share count of the company increases, so by simple math, the shares
that VCF1 holds represent a smaller proportion of the total company than
the 20 percent it originally held.
To compensate for this, VCF1 may want to invest more money in this
next round, likely in an amount equal to that required to maintain its 20
percent ownership in the company. Thus, at the time it makes the initial
$10 million investment, VCF1 will reserve, or put aside for future use,
some amount of additional dollars for subsequent financing rounds. To be
clear, this is just an accounting fiction in that the money hasn’t been
invested, but VCF1 is earmarking this money for the time being so that it
doesn’t deploy that capital into another investment.
Recall that in chapter 4 we talked about getting to know your VC firm
and, in particular, getting to know where it is in the investment life cycle
of the fund from which the firm is investing into your company. This
discussion of reserves helps articulate why that matters—if a firm is early
in its life cycle, it probably has the ability to reserve additional dollars to
participate in subsequent rounds of financing for your company. If it is
later in the fund life and thus the firm needs to start thinking more about
distributing cash back to its LPs, it may be less willing to set aside
reserves.
You of course don’t care about whether the firm is able to maintain its
full ownership by investing in subsequent rounds, but you do care about
whether the fund has cash at all to be able to invest in you. Why? Because
often when you raise a new round of financing, the new investor will want
to see that earlier investors still have faith in you and that they are willing
to demonstrate that by putting new, additional capital at risk. If the fund
is later in its life cycle and short on reserves, the fund’s inability to
participate in the new round of financing could affect the willingness of
new investors to fund the business. Similarly, if the firm has not raised (or
doesn’t seem likely to be able to raise) a new fund, there may not be
another source of capital it can tap to invest in your new financing round.
VC Valuation
So what do VCs actually do to value early-stage startups?
Wait for it—it’s called the “what do I need to believe analysis.”
I haven’t trademarked this and, to be fair, some VCs might disagree
with me on this, but in my experience, it’s true. If VCF1 invests $10 million
in XYZ Company and owns 20 percent of the company, what does the
company need to look like in five to ten years to be a meaningful return
driver, or winner, for its fund?
Let’s assume a “winner” means a return of ten times (or $100 million)
VCF1’s investment. If VCF1 owns 20 percent (and let’s ignore for now the
reserves we talked about), then to earn $100 million on the investment,
XYZ Company needs to be sold (or go public) for at least $500 million
(0.20 × $500 million = $100 million).
Borrowing from our comparable company analysis above, let’s assume
that mature comparable companies trade at a revenue multiple of five. So
to achieve our $500 million valuation goal for XYZ Company, it needs to
be generating $100 million in revenue.
So what would have to go right with the business for that to happen? Is
the market size they are going after big enough to support a company with
$100 million in revenue? What are all the things that could cause the
company to fail? How do I assess the probability of each of those nodes on
the decision tree toward success or failure? This is in practice the
valuation idea maze that VCs go through.
To be clear, we are talking here about very-early-stage investments
where there are no real financial metrics with which to value a company.
As startups get more mature and have financial statements that are more
reliable, of course later-stage venture capital deals will adopt more of the
traditional valuation metrics we’ve outlined above.
Now, back to our term sheet.
Capitalization
Notice here that VCF1 says that the valuation of the company includes the
unallocated employee option pool—in this case, 15 percent. As we talked
about before, VCF1 wants to make sure that it gets its 20 percent
ownership after all is said and done, so it doesn’t want the creation of the
option pool to dilute its ownership.
How did VCF1 come up with 15 percent as the right pool size? Honestly,
this is just a negotiation between the VC and the company CEO, but a
good rule of thumb is that the option pool should be sufficient to handle
the expected employee hiring until the next round of financing. So the VCs
often ask the CEO to generate a head-count growth plan for the next
twelve to eighteen months (the likely time frame until the company
pursues another financing round) and estimate how much stock is
required to grant to those planned hires.
The CEO would like to keep the pool size as low as possible because
increasing the pool size before the current financing round dilutes her
(and other existing common shareholders). The VC wants to make the
pool size as large as possible because if the company needs to increase the
pool after she has invested her money, she will also share in the dilution.
This is the dance.
Dividends
I am not going to waste too many words on this section because it’s
generally meaningless, since startups can’t afford to dividend out their
cash to shareholders.
All this section says is that if and when the company’s board decides to
dividend out cash to shareholders—which it will likely never do—the
dividend will be equal to 6 percent and will go to the preferred
shareholders (i.e., the VCs) first before going to the common shareholders
(i.e., founders and employees). The whole reason for this section—at least
in my humble opinion—is to prevent the founders from dividending out
money to themselves at the expense of the preferred shareholders. So if
the founders want to pillage the company’s cash, they have to pay the VCs
first. Enough said.
Liquidation Preference
Now we are getting to the good stuff.
Liquidation preference is a fancy way of saying who gets their money
back under certain circumstances. Those circumstances are called a
“liquidation event,” which basically means the company gets sold or is
being wound down. It’s true that there are corner cases where the
company could have a change of control (i.e., selling more than 50 percent
of its stock) that doesn’t involve an acquisition, but most of the time we
are talking about a company sale.
The specific type of liquidation preference in our sample term sheet is
called “1x nonparticipating.” Let’s break that down.
It’s “1x” because VCF1 gets its original investment amount back first,
but no more. Liquidation preferences can be structured to be 1.5x, 2x or
any “x” the company and VC agree upon. In those cases, the VC would be
entitled to that multiple of its original investment off the top of any sale
proceeds. Having a liquidation preference greater than 1x can be a big
hurdle for startups, because it increases the acquisition price by that
multiple of the monies invested by the VCs. As a result, 1x is the
predominant form of liquidation preference for early-stage venture
financings.
It is the case, however, that VCs that invest at later stages of a
company’s development may demand more than a 1x preference. Why is
that? The idea is that if a VC is investing at a much later stage, she might
be worried that there will not be enough upside on the investment if the
company were to sell itself in close proximity to the financing, before the
business has had a chance to grow to a point where its value is some
greater multiple of the valuation paid in the financing round.
This can be particularly worrisome for a later-stage investor if there are
a lot of other investors who invested in the company at much earlier stages
and therefore much lower valuations. Those early investors may have very
different economic incentives from this later round investor and be
motivated financially to sell the company at a more modest increase in
valuation relative to the later-stage investor’s entry valuation. Thus, a
greater than 1x liquidation preference can be a way of aligning interests
more closely among investors (and employees) who have a much lower
entry valuation into the company with those who are just entering the
company for the first time at a significantly higher valuation.
“Nonparticipating” means that the VC doesn’t get to double dip. Rather,
she gets a choice: take her liquidation preference off the top or convert her
preferred shares into common shares and take the equity value of her
percentage ownership of the company. “Participating” is the opposite
flavor—not only does the VC get her liquidation preference first (her
original investment back), but then she also gets to convert her shares into
common and participate in any leftover proceeds as with any other
shareholder. Double-dipping is pretty unusual in the standard venture
capital financing.
Let’s do a quick example to illustrate the difference.
Assume that VCF1 has invested its $10 million (for which we said it
owns 20 percent of the company) and a year later the company gets sold
for $40 million. Because we have a 1x nonparticipating liquidation
preference, VCF1 has to choose between taking its 1x off the top or
converting into common. Which does she choose? The answer is the
liquidation preference, because that nets her $10 million, whereas if she
were to convert into common, she would receive only $8 million (0.20 ×
$40 million). That will leave $30 million for the common shareholders to
take from the acquisition.
Hopefully you can see that her indifference point is at a $50 million
acquisition—she would get $10 million in liquidation preference or $10
million from converting into common and getting her 20 percent of the
$50 million acquisition price. This makes sense because she invested at a
$50 million valuation, so we would expect that to be the indifference
point.
Last example. Assume VCF1 successfully negotiated for a 1x
participating liquidation preference. How does that change the math?
Well, in the $40 million acquisition scenario, VCF1 would first get its $10
million liquidation preference, and then it would convert into common. As
part of the common shareholder base, VCF1 will get an additional $6
million (0.20 × the remaining $30 million in proceeds). So you can see
how the rest of the common shareholders are affected in this scenario—
they get to share only the $24 million remaining after VCF1’s double-
dipping versus the $30 million in the nonparticipating example.
One other nuance to liquidation preference that we don’t see in the
sample term sheet—because it’s for the first institutional financing round
of the company—is the order of preference among the various parties who
enjoy the liquidation preference. Recall that as a company goes through its
life cycle, it will often raise multiple subsequent rounds of financing, each
with a new series of preferred stock (Series B, Series C, etc.).
The question then becomes, do all the various series of preferred stock
holders share equally in the liquidation preference, or do some have
preference over the others? This preference is known as “seniority,” which
means that someone has a preference to acquisition or liquidation
proceeds ahead of the other preferred holders. The opposite of seniority is
pari passu, which is a fancy Latin saying that means we are all treated the
same. Seniority typically only gets introduced into the term sheet
negotiations at a later stage of financing when there are at least two
classes of preferred stock who might want to fight over this right; that’s
why we don’t see the discussion in this current term sheet.
At first blush as an entrepreneur, you might rightly think, “Who cares?
If I’ve agreed to a liquidation preference overall, do I really care whether
the VCs have decided among themselves to split it pari passu or to
introduce some element of seniority?” You’re right in one respect, in that
the ultimate amount of money that you and your other common
shareholders (mostly your employees) will receive in an acquisition or
liquidation is not changed by seniority—no matter how the preference gets
divided, it’s still a finite amount of money that will go to the VCs. In
practice, though, this term does matter in that it can create different
incentives for your various VCs and thus cause them to think differently
about an acquisition offer.
For example, assume you have a total of $30 million in liquidation
preference and two different series of preferred stock (A and B)
representing two different venture capital firms. Assume also that each
firm has invested $15 million in its respective class of preferred stock. If
you receive an acquisition offer for $25 million, all those proceeds would
go to the preferred holders because the acquisition price is less than the
$30 million in preferences. If the preference were pari passu, the VCs
would split it fifty-fifty, each getting $12.5 million back on their original
investments of $15 million. If the B shares were senior to the A shares,
though, the B holders would receive their full $15 million back and the A
holders would then get only the remaining $10 million.
In either case, you as a common holder are likely to get nothing because
there simply isn’t any money left over after satisfying the liquidation
preferences. But the decision to vote for or against the acquisition could be
influenced by the presence of a senior preference. As you see, the A
holders lose money on the deal as a result of a senior preference in favor of
the B holders, so they might be inclined to vote against the deal if they
think there is some prospect of getting a better deal down the road that
would make them whole. And even though you and your employees might
not be getting paid on your common stock in the current deal, you might
be getting employment offers with the acquiring company that could be
attractive, and you may also believe that being part of the acquiring
company is the best way for your original product vision to be realized.
Not being able to realize these opportunities as a result of a competing set
of incentives among your VCs would be a bad outcome.
Redemption
This explanation might even be shorter than the dividends one—no
redemption! Think about it—the whole idea behind selling equity to a VC
is that you want the money to be permanent so you can use it to build your
company. If you had wanted to pay it back on some schedule, you would
have raised debt instead. Thus, redemption is extremely unusual in VC.
But, for completeness, if it existed in the term sheet, it would basically
allow VCF1 to give back its stock to XYZ Company at some future time
period in exchange for getting its money back (and sometimes with
interest).
Redemption rights, if they exist, are likely to come into play at precisely
the worst time for the company. Why would a VC, who is playing for home
runs, want to redeem? Only if she felt as though the company were
walking dead, and thus getting her money back was a better option than
watching it slowly being vaporized. However, this is exactly when the
company would not likely have sufficient cash to be able to give the money
back. As a result, most state laws restrict the ability of investors to exercise
their redemption rights if doing so would put the company in a dire
financial situation. Thankfully, most venture deals keep things simple by
just stipulating that the investment is in fact not redeemable.
Conversion/Auto-Conversion
Let’s take these two together.
Recall that VCF1 is investing in a different security (Preferred Series A)
than the founders/other employees likely have (common shares). So, at
some point, VCF1 might want to convert its shares from preferred into
common and, at other points, the founders (and maybe other later venture
investors) might want to force VCF1 to convert into common.
Why would a VC ever want to do this (and why would the company/
others ever want to force you to do this), given that the preferred shares
have so many more rights and privileges than do common?
In the former case, a VC might want to do this as part of the IPO of the
company. To take a company public, you will want to clean up the capital
structure of the company by having everyone convert into common shares.
It’s not impossible to have multiple types of shares as a public company—
in fact, more recently we have seen many technology companies
implement “dual-class stock” as part of their IPO, which often splits
common stock into a high-voting class and a low-voting class. For
example, Google and Facebook each have dual-class voting structures, and
Snap actually has a tri-class structure. This notwithstanding, preferred
shares generally need to go away at the time of the IPO.
In most cases, an IPO is a good thing, and most VCs are more than
happy to convert their shares into common in connection with the process
of going public. But, as our term sheet reflects, VCF1 wants to make sure
that the IPO is of sufficient size—both as a way to ensure that the
valuation is attractive relative to their initial investment valuation and
that the company will have sufficient market capitalization for enough
trading liquidity (so VCF1 can at some point in time sell its shares in the
public market).
Recall that we talked earlier about the reduction in the overall number
of IPOs in the last twenty years and, in particular, the decline in the
number of smaller-capitalization IPOs. Among the reasons for this are
that smaller-cap public companies don’t have great trading liquidity. This
means that the volume of shares traded on any given day is small, making
it hard for a shareholder who has a lot of shares to be able to sell that stock
without moving down the price of the stock. To combat this, the IPO
conversion term often includes a provision that the IPO be of a specific
minimum size, which equates to a minimum expected market
capitalization of the company intended to avoid being stuck in a low-
trading-volume, small-cap stock.
In our term sheet, VCF1 agrees to be converted (we call this “auto-
conversion”) into common in connection with an IPO, as long as the
proceeds from the IPO are at least $50 million. If you assume that most
companies sell between 10 and 20 percent of the company at an IPO, this
would imply a market capitalization of $250–$500 million. In today’s
market, however, this would be a very-small-cap IPO that would be likely
to have little trading volume. But at the Series A stage of investing, it
would be hard for VCF1 to argue for a significantly higher initial IPO
market capitalization. Presumably, as there are other, later financing
rounds, this minimum IPO threshold will increase.
Another flavor of the IPO auto-convert is to put in place a specific per-
share price or a return on investment threshold to force conversion. For
example, VCF1 could have said that it would only auto-convert on an IPO
where the return on its $10 million investment was at least 3x. You
sometimes see these return-based terms in later-stage venture financings
where a new investor might be coming in close in time to an IPO and
worries that the company might go public too soon before it has seen
enough appreciation on its investment.
The other mechanism to convert shares from preferred to common that
the term sheet stipulates is a voluntary conversion. In this case, the term
sheet says that a vote of a majority of the preferred stock is another way to
convert preferred into common.
When would a VC ever want to do this? Mostly, in a bad situation.
We are going to talk later about recapitalizations of companies, but for
now let’s just agree that oftentimes things don’t go as planned in the
startup world. Believe it or not, every now and then the company raises a
lot of money and needs to effectively restart the company many years in.
At that point in time, the company may have raised several different
rounds of venture capital and thus has different investors who’ve invested
different amounts and at different valuations. As a result there might be
$30 million or $50 million or more in combined liquidation preference on
the company.
Often, in order to restart the company, you want to clean up the
capitalization table by getting rid of some or all of that liquidation
preference. Doing so may make the company more attractive to a new
investor and provide capital for the restart. For a new investor, having too
much liquidation preference simply means that the valuation the company
needs to achieve in a sale for the VC to make money on the deal may be
prohibitively high. It also helps reincent the employees who otherwise
have a very high bar to clear before they can earn any money on their
common equity. Recall that employees hold common stock, so they don’t
get any proceeds from an acquisition until the full liquidation preferences
of the VCs have been satisfied. Thus, employees can be financially
disincented to stay at the company if they don’t think there is a reasonable
prospect of an acquisition clearing the liquidation preferences. So if the
VCs believe in the go-forward prospects for the company, they might want
to volunteer to give up liquidation preference to provide the company a
fresh start.
How would a VC eliminate liquidation preference if she were so
inclined? Precisely through this conversion mechanism. Remember that
the liquidation preference attaches to the special type of shares that the
VC holds—preferred stock. If the VC were to convert her preferred shares
into common shares, the bells and whistles that she enjoyed as a preferred
shareholder would simply disappear.
And this takes us to a very clever item in our term sheet that we’ve
overlooked so far but now comes into play. Not clever as in “sneaky,” but
clever as in “smart.” Who gets to vote on whether the preferred convert
into common and thus give up liquidation preference?
Notice that the term sheet is very specific in using capital “P” Preferred
Stock as the group that has to get to a majority vote as part of the
voluntary conversion mechanism.
And who is that Preferred Stock? Go back to the dividends section of the
term sheet and you’ll see that “Preferred Stock” is defined as “any prior
series of preferred stock, Series A Preferred Stock, and all future series of
preferred stock.” This means that no matter how many different classes of
preferred stock may exist over the life of the company, they all vote
together as a single group in determining whether a majority of them
wants to voluntarily convert into common.
This is important, particularly in the case where the company turns
south after having raised many different rounds of capital, as the
alternative to this definition could have been to give each individual series
of preferred stock its own majority vote. In that case, if any one of the
different classes of stock refused to go along with the conversion, the
whole deal would grind to a halt.
This, unfortunately, is not just a theoretical risk. We’ve seen it many
times in our short history at Andreessen Horowitz, and it can create real
issues. For example, we had a portfolio company that had raised about
seven different rounds of financing in a series of ever-escalating prices.
But when the business struggled later on and was in need of a capital
infusion at a price materially lower than most of the previous rounds, the
terms from the prior rounds came back to bite everyone. That’s because
each class of preferred stock (representing each of the previous rounds of
financing) had its own conversion vote specific to its class only. There was
no majority of “Preferred” vote, but rather a series of individual votes by
each of the preferred series independently. As if that weren’t tough enough
already, each class of preferred was controlled by a separate VC firm.
Any new investor coming into the company at this point in time was
unwilling to invest new money without converting at least some, if not all,
of the existing series of preferred stock into common. Why? Because recall
that one of the rights of a preferred shareholder is often liquidation
preference, and the simplest way to get rid of liquidation preference is to
convert shares from preferred into common. Having been through seven
rounds of prior financing, the liquidation preference was sufficiently high
that the return prospects for any new investor would be materially
dampened without some abatement of the preference.
There is of course another alternative to help this new investor get
comfortable with the size of the existing preference stack—allow that new
investor to have a senior liquidation preference. Recall from our earlier
discussion that this would mean that the new investor gets her money out
first, ahead of all the other preferred investors, therefore protecting her
investment much more than if she were to be pari passu (or even) with the
other existing preferred investors.
But, as we saw before, that introduces other potential complexities. It
creates very different financial incentives between the various classes of
preferred investors in the event of an acquisition where the price does not
exceed the full amount of preferences. Also, as a common shareholder,
you would certainly prefer to have the total amount of the liquidation
stack reduced to create a greater likelihood that you and your employees
will be able to receive some proceeds from an eventual acquisition offer.
This new investor likely wants this, too, as she wants the employees
motivated to work hard toward a good financial outcome, rather than
everyone feeling as though they are working with no prospect of ever
realizing a financial return.
As you can imagine, this made it extremely difficult to get a new
investor comfortable with even issuing a term sheet and nearly killed the
company’s financing prospects. The various investors eventually worked it
out, but it took months of back-and-forth negotiations, all while the
company remained idle without the needed cash infusion to continue
building its business.
There may be times when giving different classes of preferred stock
makes sense—and you do see this oftentimes as companies get more
mature and raise larger amounts of capital at higher prices. But, doing so
for XYZ Company at such an early stage is generally not recommended.
Once you set the precedent of giving individual series of preferred stock
their own votes, it’s very hard to take that back. So for a Series A term
sheet like we have here for XYZ Company, having the capital “P” Preferred
vote on voluntary conversion is a smarter path to pursue.
Antidilution Provisions
Whenever VCs invest in a company, they hope that the valuation of the
company keeps increasing at every round. If that happens, there is no
need to worry about antidilution protection. But hope is not a strategy, so
better to be safe than sorry.
Antidilution protection provides some element of safety in the event
that the company raises money at a valuation below that at which a VC
invested. We call this a “down round,” since the valuation is in fact down
from the prior round. That’s not a fun place to be for either the VC or the
founder/employees since the effect of a down round can be highly dilutive
to everyone’s ownership stake. This is because the company will need to
issue a significant number of shares per dollar of capital it seeks to raise,
and the addition of those shares to the company’s capital stock means that
all existing shareholders will own proportionately less of the company
than they did prior to the down round.
Every new financing of course has some element of dilution, since in all
cases—whether the price is high or low—the company has to issue new
shares. But down rounds are particularly painful for two reasons. First,
the lower price means that more shares need to be issued to raise a fixed
amount of capital than if the price were higher. Second, in the case of an
“up round,” even though new shares are being issued, everyone is
generally happy, notwithstanding the dilution, because the value of the
company has increased. So while you may have been diluted by 10 percent
as a result of the issuance of new shares, the value of your ownership
position in the company should be much higher as a result of the higher
valuation assigned to the company.
So the VCs have engineered what might be safely regarded as “schmuck
insurance”—we think the company is worth five dollars per share on the
day we invest in the company, but if, in the future, the valuation turns out
to be two dollars per share, the insurance provides a price adjustment to
minimize the otherwise dilutive effect of the two-dollars-per-share
financing round.
The extent of the price adjustment depends on the precise type of
antidilution protection.
In our VCF1 term sheet we have broad-based weighted average
antidilution protection. That’s a mouthful, and the formula, which I am
not going to print here (you can Google it), is equally daunting. In simple
terms, think of the broad-based weighted average as an intermediate form
of antidilution protection. VCF1 does not get to reset its original purchase
price fully to the new, lower purchase price, but it does get a blended price
in between these two that is weighted by the amount of capital raised in
the different financing rounds.
Contrast that with the true insurance policy that provides the VC a
complete price reset—that’s called a “full ratchet.” In a full ratchet, using
our five-dollars-per-share/two-dollars-per-share example from above, our
VC would essentially ignore its original five-dollar price and reset its stock
holdings based upon the two-dollar price. Mathematically, this means the
number of shares that the VC will now hold based on its original
investment in the company increases by roughly two and a half times
(5/2). As you can see, the full ratchet therefore protects the VC from
getting diluted by this down round of financing.
But what about the founder and employees? Tough luck—they don’t
have such a mechanism, so in effect they are subsidizing the VCs’
antidilution protection by eating the dilution on their end. Before you get
too worked up over this, as a practical matter, many VCs when faced with
a situation where the antidilution protection will kick in may be willing to
offset some of that founder/employee dilution by increasing the option
pool and granting additional options to these folks. It won’t solve the
problem completely, but will put a dent in the dilution suffered by the
common shareholders.
If you take this to its logical extreme, you get into a circular problem:
the more the VCs get antidilution protection, the more the common
shareholders get diluted, and thus the more the VCs are inclined to
increase the option pool and grant them more shares, and the more in
turn this dilutes the VCs. There is no perfect equilibrium for this problem,
but sometimes the VCs will waive or modify their antidilution protection
to prevent this circular spiral.
We talked earlier about whether you should always maximize valuation
in a given round, and here is where the rubber really meets the road—in
the context of a down round. Not only do you have to deal with the lack of
momentum and upset feelings of your employee base, but down rounds
have real economic consequences in the form of antidilution protection for
the VCs.
This is largely avoidable if you try to structure your current financing to
maximize the likelihood of success for your next round of financing.
Voting Rights
This section doesn’t really say too much, as the meat of the voting is going
to come in the protective provisions section below. Important to note here,
though, is that each share—both common and preferred—has one vote. As
we briefly discussed above, when some startup companies go public, they
have different classes of shares with different voting rights. While it is not
unheard of when the companies are still private, it’s pretty unusual. In our
term sheet, the voting follows the normal convention of one person, one
vote.
As dual-class stock has started to proliferate among some public
technology companies (e.g., Facebook, Google, Snap), some startups have
been thinking about whether to adopt these structures as a private
company.
There are two flavors of this that we’ve been seeing of late. First, some
founders would like to have a high-vote stock that applies to their shares
only. The theory is that, in addition to likely controlling the board, as we’ll
talk about in the next section, they also want to ensure that any time a
corporate matter requires a shareholder vote, they have enough voting
power to retain control over those actions. For example, if the company
were to be acquired and a shareholder vote was required to approve the
transaction, if the founders have, say, ten times the number of votes per
share relative to any other shareholder, they are likely to be able to control
the outcome of that vote. There are not any instances of this type of voting
structure that I am aware of having actually been implemented in startup
companies.
What has happened in a very small number of cases is that some
founders have asked certain investors to enter into what’s called a “voting
proxy” in connection with their investment. This means that the investor
hands the voting authority for her shares to the founders, such that the
founders get to execute that voting authority in favor of whatever
corporate actions come to a vote. While this is also very unusual, we do
sometimes see this with very-late-stage, passive investors who are
interested in the financial investment opportunity only and not in
participating in the governance of the company.
The second variety of dual-class structures, which is more common than
the first (although still in a minority of deals), is to put in place what’s
known as a springing dual-class structure in anticipation of an IPO. This
means that we keep the one person, one vote construct while the company
is private, but that immediately prior to an IPO, the dual class springs into
being. The usual implementation of this is to have all existing shares at the
time of the IPO convert into supervoting shares, including both common
and preferred shares. Then the shares that are issued in the IPO have the
regular one person, one vote. The theory here is that over time the venture
investors will exit the company by selling their stock in the public markets
and, when they do so, the supervoting attached to those shares disappears.
Thus, likely within the first few years of the company’s being public, the
founders are left with significant governance control because they still
have their supervoting shares, while the general public holds shares with
only the single-vote structure
