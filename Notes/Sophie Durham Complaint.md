**Re: Fee Status Discrepancy for Sophie Griggs (UCAS 1864262306) - Computer Science Programme**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to appeal the decision to classify my daughter, Sophie Griggs, as an international student for fee purposes for the Computer Science programme at Durham University. This classification differs from the "home" fee status granted to her twin sister, Hannah Griggs (UCAS 1864262609), who has been offered a place in the Natural Sciences programme.

## Background

My daughters, Hannah and Sophie, are both natural-born British citizens with identical residency backgrounds. They have resided at the same address and under the same circumstances their entire lives. Both daughters have received "home" student classifications from other UK universities to which they have applied. However, despite their identical backgrounds, Durham University has classified Hannah as 'home' and Sophie as 'international'. This inconsistency requires urgent review.

## Request for Review

I request an immediate review of my fee status classification. This inconsistent treatment of twins, both British citizens with identical residency backgrounds, raises questions about fairness and transparency in the admissions process at Durham University. To be clear, there is no basis for our fee status to be determined by our academic choices or course selection.

Given the seriousness of this discrepancy, my sister's 'home' student classification, and the limited time remaining to accept university offers, I am submitting this complaint directly to the formal Stage 2 process, as outlined in the University's Complaints Procedure for Applicants. I believe a formal review is immediately necessary to resolve this urgent matter fairly and transparently.

## Background

## Wider Implications

This inconsistent treatment of twins, both British citizens with identical life-long residency backgrounds, requires clear justification. The difference between home and international fees constitutes a significant barrier to Sophie's education. Given the national imperative to encourage female participation in STEM fields, this situation warrants particularly careful consideration. Unjustified, the situation has the potential for reputational damage to Durham University.

## Requested Outcome

I respectfully request that Sophie's fee status be reclassified to 'home' status, aligning with her sister's classification. 

I would appreciate a response outlining the decision, and the reasons for it, within 10 working days. I have already provided significant documentation on this matter to the admissions department, and to the specific admissions officer who designated Sophie incorrectly.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Yours faithfully,

V Tocco
