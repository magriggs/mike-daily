**Re: Fee Status Discrepancy for Sophie Griggs (UCAS 1864262306) - Computer Science Programme**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to appeal the decision to classify my daughter, Sophie Griggs, as an international student for fee purposes for the Computer Science programme at Durham University. This classification differs from the "home" fee status granted to her twin sister, Hannah Griggs (UCAS 1864262609), who has been accepted to the Natural Sciences programme.

## Background

My daughters, Hannah and Sophie, are both natural-born British citizens with identical residency backgrounds. They have resided at the same address and under the same circumstances their entire lives.  Both daughters have received "home" student classifications from other UK universities to which they have applied.

While Hannah has been classified as a 'home' student by Durham University for the Natural Sciences programme, Sophie has been designated as an international student for Computer Science.

## Request for Review

I request an immediate review of Sophie's fee status classification.  Such inconsistent treatment of twins, both British citizens with identical residency backgrounds, raises serious questions about fairness and transparency in the fee assessment process. For the avoidance of doubt, there is no basis for their fee status to be determined on their academic background or course selection.

## Wider Implications

This inconsistent treatment of twins, both British citizens with identical life-long residency backgrounds, requires clear justification. The difference between home and international fees constitutes a significant barrier to Sophie's education. Given the national imperative to encourage female participation in STEM fields, this situation warrants particularly careful consideration. Unjustified, the situation has a potential for reputational damage to Durham University.

## Requested Outcome

I respectfully request that Sophie's fee status be reclassified to 'home' status, aligning with her sister's classification and reflecting their shared citizenship and residency eligibility under UK regulations.

I would appreciate a response outlining the decision, and the reasons for it, within 10 working days. I have already provided significant documentation on this matter to the admissions department, and to the specific admissions officer who designated Sophie incorrectly.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Yours faithfully,

V Tocco
