**Re: Urgent Appeal Regarding Fee Status Determination for Sophie [Your Surname] - Computer Science Programme**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to formally appeal the decision to classify my daughter, Sophie [Your Surname], as an international student for fee purposes for the Computer Science programme at Durham University. This classification is in direct contradiction to the "home" fee status granted to her twin sister, Hannah [Your Surname], who has been accepted to the Natural Sciences programme.

## Background

My daughters, Hannah and Sophie, are natural-born British citizens. They have identical residency backgrounds, having resided at the same address and under the same circumstances their entire lives.  Both daughters have applied to study at Durham University, and, crucially, both have received "home" student classifications from *other* UK universities to which they've applied.

Despite their identical circumstances and citizenship, Hannah has been correctly classified as a 'home' student by Durham University for the Natural Sciences programme, while Sophie has inexplicably been designated as an international student for Computer Science.

This discrepancy is perplexing, and I can identify no valid basis for it.

## Request for Immediate Review

I urgently request an immediate review of Sophie's fee status classification.  The contradictory designation of two students with identical backgrounds raises serious concerns.

It is vital to emphasize that their academic choices and performance have no bearing on their fee status eligibility; their citizenship and residency history are the *sole* determinants.

## Wider Implications and Justification

This inconsistent treatment of twins, both British citizens with identical life-long residency backgrounds, appears to be an error. However, should this not be the case, such a substantial difference between home and international fees requires robust and justifiable explanation. Without this, there is the potential for significant reputational damage to Durham University. Furthermore, considering the national imperative to encourage female participation in STEM fields, this situation is especially concerning.

The substantial difference between home and international fees presents a significant barrier to Sophie's education. The timeline for accepting university offers is rapidly approaching, necessitating swift action.

## Requested Outcome

I respectfully request that Sophie's fee status be immediately reclassified to 'home' status, aligning with her sister's classification and reflecting their shared citizenship and residency eligibility under UK regulations.

I would appreciate a response outlining the decision, and the reasons for it, within 10 working days. Should you require any additional documentation regarding my daughters' citizenship or residency, I am happy to provide it. We are particularly keen to understand what evidence they used as part of their decision-making process.

Thank you for your prompt and impartial attention to this critical matter.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]
