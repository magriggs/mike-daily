**Re: Fee Status Discrepancy for Sophie Griggs (UCAS 1864262306) - Computer Science Programme**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to appeal the decision to classify me, Sophie Griggs, as an international student for fee purposes for the Computer Science programme at Durham University. This classification is inconsistent with the "home" fee status granted to my twin sister, Hannah Griggs (UCAS 1864262609), who has been offered a place in the Natural Sciences programme.

## Request for Review

I request an immediate review of my fee status classification. This inconsistent treatment of twins, both British citizens with identical residency backgrounds, raises questions about fairness and transparency in the admissions process at Durham University. To be clear, there is no basis for our fee status to be determined by our academic choices or course selection.

Given the seriousness of this discrepancy, significant previous correspondence with the admissions department to provide documentation, etc., and the limited time remaining to accept university offers, I am submitting this complaint directly to the formal Stage 2 process, as outlined in the University's Complaints Procedure for Applicants. I believe a formal review is immediately necessary to resolve this urgent matter fairly and transparently.

## Background

Hannah and I are both natural-born British citizens with identical residency backgrounds. We have lived at the same address and under the same circumstances all our lives. We have both received "home" student classifications from other UK universities to which we have applied. However, despite our identical backgrounds, Durham University has classified Hannah as 'home' and me as 'international'. This inconsistency requires urgent review.

## Wider Implications

This inconsistent treatment requires clear justification. The difference between home and international fees constitutes a significant barrier to *my* education. Given the national imperative to encourage female participation in STEM fields, this warrants careful consideration. The situation will, I fear erode trust in the Durham process and reputation if unjustified.

## Requested Outcome

I respectfully request that my fee status be reclassified to 'home' status, aligning with my sister's classification. Without this correction, both Hannah and I will have to reject our Durham offers and attend other universities where we can remain together. 

I would appreciate a response outlining the decision, and the reasons for it, within 10 working days. I have already provided significant documentation on this matter to the admissions department, and to the specific admissions officer who designated me incorrectly, so this should assist with your review.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Yours faithfully,

Sophie Griggs
