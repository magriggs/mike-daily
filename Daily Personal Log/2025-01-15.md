Cognito user pool is under wealthstream_mgmt account, in us-east-2 region.

## CORS
Major changes required to fix CORS. Issues were:
1. Expecting FQDN including *port* as to validate the CORS origin. Eventually changed this to just require FQDN.
2. User error where I was trying to login from wealthstream-app-server:3000 instead of the FQDN. Don't do that.
