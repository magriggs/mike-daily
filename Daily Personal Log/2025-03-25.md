## PACE team meeting

Question for Dustin:
I lead PACE for GFS in Asia Pacific and Japan. 
I see you have lots of coverage in UK and US, what coverage do you have in APJ and how can you help us scale?

What metrics do you use to measure success in PACE?

What work do you do with partners? Do you co-build
