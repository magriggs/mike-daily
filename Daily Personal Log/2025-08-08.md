# HSBC Contact Centre Gordon Tam meeting notes 
Heidi - finding it difficult to get people from PACE to work on things. New ways of working: submit formal applications to get assistance. 

hsbc rfi for contact center. using genesys. why: genesys has told them the existing soln has to move to cloud in next 3 years. customer annoyed. new cio has 'mandate'/strategy to build as much as they can. have identified things where they can build. also considered Amazon Connect, whcih we didn't win. They have a program  "contact center AAS" building capabilities that genesys doesn't have, and devleop on aws. target: have voice func mvp by end of the year. MVP but funded. Account team looking to use credits to use proserve, which takes weeks/months to build biz case. long journey.

immediate: 2-3 areas want tech help. Kafka: nutshell want to build ESB to handle voice recordings. The team is an AWS team, have 4-5 resources in Guangzhou (customer based in Guangzhou). High Availability, scale-in/scale-out with ECS containers. 

deploy global: mandarin, catonese, hindi, malay, english. handle intent as well.
