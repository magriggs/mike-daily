Finally fixed the CORS. Realised that there was competing logic in different usvcs. Got Cline to centralise it and then COMMENT the code so that it wouldn't change it in the future. Something to remember. 

Now working on the 'optimise' branch. This is work to remove duplicate database calls. Currently getting errors where requests are returned as failed, instead of being queued up by the server.
