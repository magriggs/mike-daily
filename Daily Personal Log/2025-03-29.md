A good evening's coding. Eventually figured out how to fix the date picker reload issue. Also got the portfolio import working for a basic file format. This has been merge-squashed to main.

Need to go through backlog of bugs on Trello, and also improve the portfolio loading functionality (maybe?). 

Still need to solve the dynamic symbol lookup whilst typing.
