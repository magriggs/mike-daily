Day 21 reached - zero alcohol.

A lot has changed, all of it for the better. I have hardly had an alcohol craving, and haven't even really been close to relapsing. There was one evening where I was considering having a drink - Val's birthday dinner in the Maldives - but even then I wanted to wait and see how I felt after my water arrived. Once it arrived I was perfectly content, so I drank nothing.

We are back sleeping together again, and in my ways things are better than they have been in a long while. The O/R question is still hanging there, but between her birthday and the kids coming back on Monday, now just isn't the time to go into it. I'm still reading The O/R Book, and whilst I respect and admire their grown up approach, I do wonder how realistic it is. I suspect it would be a lot harder and a lot messier to do it for real. Unimaginably more so between Val and I.

Alcohol controls me, I don't control it. Alcohol is a poison that I don't need. Cravings I feel for alcohol are just withdrawal symptoms from the alcohol itself. Non-drinkers don't get cravings. I can be a non-drinker. I've lost too many friends, and hurt too many people I care about, to go back to the old me.
