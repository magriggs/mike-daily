Fixed various errors with the portfolio details page loading. Finally working and merged to main.

Started working on branch `import-file` and having issues. The UI should be bringing up a modal dialog *after* clicking on "Open", but instead we get the error:

```
portfolio.Dy2aPFXc.js:6 Error importing portfolio: TypeError: r.keys is not a function

```

Cline/Claude has been going around in circles trying to fix it, eventually blowing up the context window of 200k tokens (twice!). Might need to go and look at this manually to understand what is happening, or at least guide the AI. Even telling it off didn't work, and I ended up frustrated myself!
