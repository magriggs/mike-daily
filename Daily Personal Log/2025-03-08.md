A midlife crisis is a behavior burst that often occurs just before settling down, typically rooted in long-ignored desires from the past, the realization of one's own mortality, and a strong need to assess whether someone is truly living the life they want.

# Summary and Suggested Treatment Plan

## Our Discussion Summary

We've explored several interconnected challenges you're experiencing:

1. **Self-destructive behaviors** - particularly continuing to drink alcohol past the point you know you should stop, despite awareness of potential negative consequences

2. **Contributing factors**:
   - Emotional regulation difficulties, especially after consuming alcohol
   - Low self-worth
   - Internal distress that may be inadequately processed
   - Possible neurodevelopmental differences (pending assessment for ASD and ADHD)

3. **Life context**:
   - You're 47 years old
   - Married for 15 years, together for 21 years
   - Children recently turned 18 and are leaving home
   - Currently awaiting results of psychological assessment

4. **Potential neurodevelopmental considerations**:
   - Undiagnosed ASD/ADHD may have contributed to lifelong challenges with emotional regulation
   - These conditions might influence how you process social situations and sensory inputs
   - The impact on executive functioning could make it difficult to interrupt behaviors once started

7. **Develop sustainable coping strategies**
   - Create personalized emotional regulation techniques based on what works best for your neurotype
   - Build lifestyle supports that reduce overall stress and sensory overload
