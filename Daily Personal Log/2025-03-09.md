I slept alone last night. It felt appropriate, I don't think she can have me so close to her now that she knows what she knows. 

I am continuing to read the Allen Carr book. It makes a lot of sense to me. I am starting to see how 1. alcohol controls me, I don't control it. 2. That the 'gateway' drink is the first drink, not the third, fifth, or tenth. 3. That alcohol is a poison, and when I get the urge to drink it, it's because I'm having withdrawal effects, not because I need alcohol. Non-drinkers don't get the urge to drink alcohol. 

One day at a time. It's not clear what the future will hold.
