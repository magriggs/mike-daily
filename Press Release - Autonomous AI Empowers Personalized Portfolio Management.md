**SINGAPORE - May 15, 2025** – WealthGuardian unveils its agentic AI architecture that autonomously generates, simulates, and optimizes investment portfolios through self-directed workflows. This breakthrough enables real-time adaptation to market conditions and delivers tailored portfolio strategies to users in plain language.

## Updated Customer FAQs

### How does agentic AI improve portfolio creation?

WealthGuardian’s system uses a team of specialized AI agents working together:

1. **Profile Agent**
    - Analyzes natural language inputs, capturing life circumstances, financial goals, and risk preferences.
    - Converts user scenarios into a structured investor profile with dozens of relevant parameters.
2. **Portfolio Architect Agent**
    - Generates multiple diversified portfolio templates based on the user’s profile.
    - Balances objectives such as growth, stability, and risk aversion.
    - Example output for a "\$500k retirement portfolio":

```
Conservative: 60% Treasury Ladder | 30% Dividend Stocks | 10% Gold ETF
Balanced: 50% Sector ETFs | 40% Corporate Bonds | 10% REITs
```

3. **Simulation Orchestrator Agent**
    - Runs thousands of Monte Carlo simulations on each portfolio template.
    - Integrates real-time market data and scenario analysis.
    - Presents results as clear, actionable summaries (e.g., expected return ranges, probability of reaching financial goals, potential drawdowns).

### How does the system handle market changes?

WealthGuardian’s agentic architecture continuously monitors market data and user portfolios:

- **Market Sentinel Agent** scans a wide range of economic indicators and asset prices.
- **Rebalance Optimizer** suggests timely adjustments if portfolio allocations drift from the user’s intended strategy.
- **Client Interaction Gateway** allows users to review and approve any proposed portfolio changes.

**Key Components**

1. **Autonomous Workflow Engine**
    - Manages communication between AI agents using an event-driven architecture.
    - Enables real-time data sharing and decision-making across agents.
2. **Simulation Infrastructure**
    - Monte Carlo engine powered by open-source financial libraries.
    - GPU-accelerated scenario processing for rapid analysis and feedback.

### How do we implement NLP portfolio generation?

Our 3-day hackathon strategy includes:

- Using a financial-specific natural language model to parse user scenarios and extract key profile information.
- Pre-built portfolio templates based on modern portfolio theory and historical performance data.
- Integration with a Monte Carlo simulation engine for instant risk and return projections.
- All processing is privacy-first, with sensitive data handled securely and, where possible, on-device.


### Post-Hackathon Roadmap

1. **Agent Specialization**
    - Add new agents for ESG investing, cryptocurrency, or alternative assets.
    - Enhance personalization with agents focused on specific life events or goals.
2. **Performance Enhancements**
    - Implement federated learning for ongoing portfolio optimization.
    - Expand real-time data integration for even more responsive rebalancing.
